# Book_Recommendation_System

This project made by Dhananjay Kansule.

We implemented a book recommendation system using machine learning, where the default behavior is to recommend the top 50 books based on matrix factorization of user rating data. For personalized recommendations, the system applies collaborative filtering, leveraging cosine similarity to identify and suggest similar books a user has already engaged with. The user interface is developed using Flask for backend routing and HTML for frontend rendering.

To run it app.py will run through flask.
